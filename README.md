Railway Reservation System using python and sqlite

This Train Reservation and Management System is a simple application built using Python, Streamlit, and SQLite. It allows administrators to add, view, search, and delete train records along with managing seat reservations. Users can book and cancel tickets based on seat type (Window, Aisle, Middle) and passenger details. The system dynamically creates and manages seat availability for each train. It also displays data in an organized format using Pandas. This project is ideal for learning database handling and UI development in Python.
